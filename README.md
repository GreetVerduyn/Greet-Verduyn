# I am Greet
cheerful mother of 2 beautiful sons


## education
I am a dietitian by training, but because I missed some challenge at work, I decided to retrain.

I am currently taking a Junior Web Development course at BeCode (Antwerp) 

What I have learned so far: 
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - JavaScript
  - NodeJS
  - Angular
  - React
  - PHP
  - Symfony
  - MVC
  - OOP
  
... and am looking forward to gaining some work experience during my first job as a developer.
